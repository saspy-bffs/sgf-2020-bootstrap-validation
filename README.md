# Simple and Efficient Bootstrap Validation of Predictive Models Using SAS/STAT Software

### Materials for an invited paper at [SAS Global Forum](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum.html), which was originally scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on April 1, 2020. (The conference was unfortunately cancelled, due to COVID-19 concerns.)

Materials provided:

- [Full conference paper](SGF2020-Paper-Simple_and_Efficient_Bootstrap_Validation.pdf)

- [Slides](SGF2020-Paper-Simple_and_Efficient_Bootstrap_Validation-slides.pdf)

- Running example from the paper in both [Jupyter Notebook](SGF2020-Paper-Simple_and_Efficient_Bootstrap_Validation-Examples.ipynb) and [.sas](SGF2020-Paper-Simple_and_Efficient_Bootstrap_Validation-Examples.sas) format

## Prerequisites

The Jupyter Notebook example file assumes SAS University Edition ([https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition/download-software.html)) is being used.

However, any installation of SAS 9.4 with SAS/STAT can be used for the .sas version.
